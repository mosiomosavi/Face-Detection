# Face Detection GUI

This project is a simple GUI-based application for real-time face detection using Python. It combines OpenCV for face detection and Tkinter for the graphical interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detects faces from the webcam feed using Haar cascades.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Displays bounding boxes and labels around detected faces.
- **Interactive GUI**: Start and stop the video feed directly from the GUI.
- **Threading**: Ensures a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **Webcam**: The application uses your webcam for the video feed.
